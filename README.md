# Logitech G29 Racing Wheel Support for Easy Delivery Company

Based on the [SteeringWheel](https://github.com/craftxbox/edco-SteeringWheel) plugin by [craftxbox](https://github.com/craftxbox)

Game can be found here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/

This plugin requires BepInEx: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

To use, just drop `SteeringWheel.dll` in `Steam\steamapps\common\Easy Delivery Co\BepInEx\plugins`

This has only been tested with the Playstation 3/4 version of the [Logitech G29 Racing Wheel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/shop/p/driving-force-racing-wheel.941-000110) on Windows 10 with the switch set to `PS4`.  I have no idea if this will work for anyone else but me, and I probably can't offer any support for it.

In the Logitech G HUB software, I'd recommend the following settings:
* Sensitivity: 50
* Operating Range (Angle): 840
* Centering Spring Strength: 20 (and check the box for "Centering Spring in Non Force Feedback Games")

## Button Mappings

**Note**: Effects from the shifter are only present while the button is held (so re-centering the shifter or changing gears undoes the previous effect).

Despite having a 7th/Reverse gear (Press the shifter in, then move the shifter), I've opted to use gear 6 for reverse gear just for comfort/convenience.

* **Shifter - Gear 1 (top-left)**: Triple wheel sensitivity for faster turning
* **Shifter - Gear 2 (bottom-left)**: Double wheel sensitivity for faster turning
* **Shifter - Gear 3 (top-left)**: Halves wheel sensitivity for slower, smoother turning
* **Shifter - Gear 4 (bottom-left)**: Doubles gas/brake pedal sensitivity
* **Shifter - Gear 5 (top-right)**: Halves gas/brake pedal sensitivity
* **Shifter - Gear 6 (bottom-right)**: Reverse gas/brake pedals (reverse gear)
