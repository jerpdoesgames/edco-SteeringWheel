# Logitech G29 Racing Wheel Support for Easy Delivery Company

Based on the [SteeringWheel](https://github.com/craftxbox/edco-SteeringWheel) plugin by [craftxbox](https://github.com/craftxbox)

Game can be found here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/

This plugin requires BepInEx: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

To use, just drop `SteeringWheel.dll` in `Steam\steamapps\common\Easy Delivery Co\BepInEx\plugins`


This has only been tested with a Logitech G29 Racing Wheel on Windows 10 with the switch set to `PS4`.  I have no idea if this will work for anyone else but me, and I probably can't offer any support for it.
