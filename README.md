# Logitech G29 Racing Wheel Support for Easy Delivery Company

Based on the [SteeringWheel](https://github.com/craftxbox/edco-SteeringWheel) plugin by [craftxbox](https://github.com/craftxbox)

Game can be found here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/

This plugin requires BepInEx: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

To use, just drop `SteeringWheel.dll` in `Steam\steamapps\common\Easy Delivery Co\BepInEx\plugins`

This has only been tested with a [Logitech G29 Racing Wheel](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/shop/p/driving-force-racing-wheel.941-000110) on Windows 10 with the switch set to `PS4`.  I have no idea if this will work for anyone else but me, and I probably can't offer any support for it.

## Button Mappings

* **Wheel Turn**: Steer Left/Right
* **Gas Pedal**: Move Forward
* **Brake Pedal**: Move Backward
* **L1 (metal bar)**: Brake/Back
* **R1 (metal bar)**: Honk Horn
* **L2**: Lights
* **R2**: Interact/OK
* **DPad Up**: Camera
* **DPad Left**: Map/Items
* **DPad Right**: Job Selection
* **+/-**: Radio Scan
* **Red Wheel Counter-Clockwise**: Previous Radio Channel
* **Red Wheel Clockwise**: Next Radio Channel
* **Red Wheel Button**: Radio On/Off
* **Playstation Button**: Pause
* **Share Button**: Reset (instant - no hold required)

**Note**: Effects from the shifter are only present while the button is held (so re-centering the shifter or changing gears undoes the previous effect).

For some reason, the G29 I'm testing with does not appear to have the 7th (Reverse) gear position, so I'm using Gear 6 for reverse.

* **Shifter - Gear 1 (top-left)**: Triple wheel sensitivity for faster turning
* **Shifter - Gear 2 (bottom-left)**: Double wheel sensitivity for faster turning
* **Shifter - Gear 3 (top-left)**: Halves wheel sensitivity for slower, smoother turning
* **Shifter - Gear 4 (bottom-left)**: Doubles gas/brake pedal sensitivity
* **Shifter - Gear 5 (top-right)**: Halves gas/brake pedal sensitivity
* **Shifter - Gear 6 (bottom-right)**: Reverse gas/brake pedals (reverse gear)
